     * What is the difference between assertion and verification?
     * Assertion means hard assertion. Verification means soft assertion. Verification is similar to if else statement.
     * If hard assertion fails, rest of the test case stops.
     * What is the difference between soft assert and hard assert?
     * Hard assertion stops execution, after assertion failure. Soft assert continues to execute even after failure
     * We need to create a soft assert object to do soft assertion
     * assertAll() need to be used in soft assert to make the actual result
     * Which assertion do you prefer? Why?
     * I used both. Both assertion are useful. But I used hard assertion the most, because I need to fix the issue the moment it shows up. It usually doesn’t make sense to wait for other tests if there is a failure.
     * If there are  lots of test cases , I prefer to use hard assert to find the wrong test case quickly to fix it.
     * If I use soft assertion, It will run all the tests every time even there are wrong cases in them. I usually use soft assertion when I write new test cases to see if all good or some fails.
